# Neighborhood Map Project

Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project

This project includes an interactive map of some of my favorite places to go in the Hudson Valley. There are google markers showing the location of these places, with the Foursquare photo API integrated into them to give you a glimpse into what they look like. You can also filter the list and markers according to the categories of "Food", "Shopping" and "Outdoor Activites". Explore and enjoy!
